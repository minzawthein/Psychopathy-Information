                TO THE BEST of our knowledge, there is no cure for psychopathy. No pill can instill empathy, no vaccine can prevent murder in cold blood, and no amount of talk therapy can change an uncaring mind. For all intents and purposes, psychopaths are lost to the normal social world.But that hasn’t stopped the scientists who study psychopaths from trying to bring them back. In 2012, Dr. Kent Kiehl, a psychologist at the University of Mexico and one of the foremost experts on psychopathy, discovered that psychopaths have reduced gray matter in the paralimbic system of the brain. His longtime suspicions were confirmed: Psychopaths – who are unremorseful and antisocial – have fundamentally different brains than the rest of us. The finding was replicated in psychopathic youth the following year. While the link between brain structure and psychopathy is correlational, the youth data strongly suggested that the stunted paralimbic system is present from birth.Kiehl was proud of the discovery and the hard work that realized it, but saddened by the accompanying implications.“It was if my lab had discovered a new disorder, but we didn’t have a cure,” Kiehl lamented in his new book, The Psychopath Whisperer.Hope remained, however. Roughly 1,300 miles away from Kiehl’s lab in Albuquerque, New Mexico, mental health professionals in Madison, Wisconsin were taking big steps to treat young psychopaths with a progressive new approach to criminal rehabilitation.DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED by staff at the Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center (MJTC), the Decompression Model operates without the strict deterrence and punishment commonplace at a normal juvenile facility.

              <p class=" col-sm-4 text-justify">
                For psychopaths, who give little thought to punishment and rarely, if ever, learn from it, the status quo devolves into a vicious cycle of discipline and defiance. Punishment doesn’t discourage their criminality; it cements it. Indeed, psychopaths are six times more likely than other criminals to commit new crimes following release from prison.The Decompression Model at MJTC was originally enacted on the most troubled youth criminals in Wisconsin.“Nearly all the boys sent to MJTC had been deemed uncontrollable at the other institutions,” Kiehl described. “Indeed, the average youth sent to MJTC had over a dozen formally filed charges.”They also averaged in the severe range on the Youth Psychopathy Checklist, the gold standard for predicting whether a youth will be diagnosed a full-fledged psychopath as an adult.The hallmark of the Decompression Model is positive reinforcement. The institutionalized youth are monitored continuously by all staff members for any sign of positive behavior, however small. When spotted, the behavior is reinforced with some sort of reward. The youth are also told that their rewards can scale, meaning the longer they persist with good behavior, the greater the prizes become. What starts out as a pat on the shoulder graduates to a candy bar, which graduates to the right to play video games, and so on and so forth. The youth were being introduced to the simple benefits of social society.The staff drew on neuroscience to decide on the rewards.“Brain scan studies have shown that both candy bars and video games are intrinsically rewarding–that is, the reward learning centers of the brain are engaged by both food and video games,” Kiehl explained.SO, HAS

                THE Decompression Model worked? In various studies, over 300 subjects who were treated at MJTC were matched with similar subjects not treated at MJTC. Researchers followed both groups over a five-year period, even after they were released.“The results,” Kiehl wrote, “were nothing short of staggering.”98% of the non-MJTC youth were arrested again within four years, while only 64% of MJTC youth were.“In other words, the MJTC program had resulted in a 34 percent reduction in recidivism,” Kiehl wrote.Moreover, MJTC youth were 50% less likely to commit a violent crime, and, while non-MJTC youth killed 16 people after their release, MJTC youth didn’t commit a single homicide! Furthermore, detailed economic analysis revealed that for every $10,000 spent at MJTC, the state of Wisconsin saved $70,000 by reducing the future costs of incarceration. That value didn’t even include the savings to society. After all, crime exacts a tremendous monetary and an emotional toll.What could explain the striking behavioral changes? Could the Decompression Model actually be stimulating the development of new grey matter in the paralimbic system of the brain? Kiehl thinks it may very well be. In 2012, his laboratory deployed a mobile brain scanner to the grounds of MJTC to see <b>whether or not inmates’ brains are actually affected by the treatment.“We want to know if decompression therapy changes the function and structure of the paralimbic system,” Kiehl recently noted. “The project is just getting started…”Kiehl has high hopes for the MJTC program. If we can identify and treat pyschopaths early on, thousands of lives might just be saved.</b>

          <h4 class="text-justify container-fluid">1.They speak in the past tense.</h4>
          <p class="text-justify container-fluid">
            Psychopaths use more past-tense verbs than other people. When talking about an event happening right now, most of us would say, "I think this is a good idea." A psychopath might be more likely to say, "I thought that was a good idea." Researchers suspect this is because they are detached from their behavior and their environment.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-justify container-fluid">2.Their body language is convincing.</h4>
          <p class="text-justify container-fluid">
            Psychopaths lie to make themselves look good. But their nonverbal behavior is often so convincing--and distracting--that people don't recognize they're being deceitful. In the police interview with murderer and rapist Paul Bernadino, FBI agents noticed he used powerful hand gestures to distract from his spoken lies
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-justify container-fluid">3. Their language lacks emotional dimension.</h4>
          <p class="text-justify container-fluid">
            For psychopaths, saying, "I love you," doesn't stir up any more emotion than saying, "Please pass the milk." They can parrot back what they've heard other people say but their facial expressions don't match their words. Their ability to verbalize feelings is most likely a learned behavior, as opposed to a genuine emotional experience.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-justify container-fluid">4. They sound charming.</h4>
          <p class="text-justify container-fluid">
            Researchers have found that psychopaths talk more and use more emotional words in an attempt to gain attention and admiration. Psychopaths are really good at saying just the right thing at the right time. They know how to play on other people's emotions and they're master manipulators.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-justify container-fluid">5. They speak slowly and quietly.</h4>
          <p class="text-justify container-fluid">
            Studies show psychopaths usually speak in a controlled manner. They don't emphasize emotional words like other people do. Their tone remains fairly neutral throughout the conversation. Researchers suspect they craft a calm demeanor intentionally because it helps them gain more control in their personal interactions.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-justify container-fluid">6. They talk about life in terms of cause and effect.</h4>
          <p class="text-justify container-fluid">
            Psychopaths--especially those who commit crimes--talk about their behavior in terms of cause and effect. For example, one might say, "I had to teach him a lesson." Rather than show remorse, a psychopath is likely to justify his actions.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-justify container-fluid">7. They focus their attention on their basic needs.</h4>
          <p class="text-justify container-fluid">
            Rather than talk about spiritual or emotional needs or the needs of others, psychopaths are more likely to talk about their own basic needs, like food and shelter. A psychopath who confesses to a murder, for example, is more likely to spend the bulk of his time talking about what he ate for lunch and what he hoped to gain financially, rather than how his behavior affected other people.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-justify container-fluid">8. They say, "um" more often.</h4>
          <p class="text-justify container-fluid">
            Psychopaths are more likely to use filler words and sounds, like "uh" and "um." While many people use such sounds to avoid an awkward silence, researchers suspect psychopaths use them in an effort to appear sane.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-justify container-fluid">9. They're great storytellers.</h4>
          <p class="text-justify container-fluid">
            Whether a psychopath claims she rescued kittens from a burning building or says she was the only one at her last job who was willing to stand up to management, psychopaths tell rich stories about themselves. While some stories are likely to paint them as victims, the bulk of their stories are likely to portray them as heroes. All of their stories stem from their desire to gain trust and manipulate their listeners.
